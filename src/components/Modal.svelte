    <h2>Art Off the Rails</h2>
    <p>
      Often times, the subway station is a sensory explosion.
      There's a cacophony of noises, a blurring rush of visual
      spectacles, and hopefully minimal suspicious smells. Within
      this dance that millions of New Yorkers two step in everyday,
      there hidden moments of free (well $2.90 really) art that 
      tangos around us. Through the Permanent Art Program, Arts
      for Transit commissions public art across MTA NYC Transit, 
      LIRR, Metro-North, and Staten Island Rail. We pass by so much
      art everyday without even realizing it. How many of these have 
      you seen in your daily commutes?
